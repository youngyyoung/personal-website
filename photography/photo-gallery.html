            <p>Here's some of my photos that I like - either because they look nice or they are contextually interesting in some manner. Please open images in a new tab to view larger versions.</p>

            <figure class="top">
                <img src="./truck-2021.jpg" alt="Photo of some trucks after sunset">
                <div>Nikon F5, Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8D, Fuji C200, Arizona. This was a bit after sunset and I thought the sodium lamp illuminated scene was rather interesting.</div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="right">
                <img src="./patio-2021.jpg" alt="Photo of balcony with chairs">
                <div>Nikon F5, AF-S Nikkor 18-35mm, Fuji C200. This was at the University of Arizona's College of Optical Sciences.</div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="top">
                <img src="./cacti-2021.jpg" alt="Photo-cacti on a hill">
                <div>Nikon F5, Micro-Nikkor 105mm f/2.8D, FUji C200, Tucson AZ. Cacti on mountains is rather typical of the Tucson landscape.</div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="left">
                <img src="./trees-mountain.jpg" alt="photo of a mountain and some trees">
                <div>Taken in Canada around 2016 with a Zorki 3 on Fuji C200. Home processed and scanned.</div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="top">
                <img src="./bird.jpg" alt="photo of a bird in flight">
                <div>I like birding and action photography but it's difficult without rather expensive equipment (lenses, specifically). Luckily, this bird was large and close, although I still had to crop the image considerably. I used a friend's Nikon D3500 with the 70-300mm kit lens. The setup performs very well. I'm very new to birding, but I believe it's a double-crested Cormorant. </div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="left">
                <img src="./crane.jpg" alt="photo of a tower crane with a building">
                <div>I took this in downtown Austin in 2021 (Nikon D3500, 70-300mm kit lens) and it's edited slightly to make the colors stand out a bit more. I really like longer lenses as it allows me to be more picky about framing.</div>
            </figure>
            <figure class="right">
                <img src="./crayons.jpg" alt="photo of some crayons">
                <div>This was taken the same way as the photo of my F5 on the "equipment" page - with my Epson Perfection 1660 scanner. I arranged the crayons on the glass, took the cover off, and scanned in reflective mode. It's an old scanner but the raw output was 141 megapixels, since this was over the entire 8.5x11" area with 1200 DPI resolution. </div>
