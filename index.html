					<p>
						Hi, I'm Young He, a first-year undergraduate at the University of Texas at Austin.<br>
						I'm pursuing a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE).<br>
						I have lots of interests, including
						<ul>
							<li>Photography and anything to do with optics/imaging</li>
							<li>Analog circuit design (including RF, I'm currently studying for my Technician class amateur radio license</li>
							<li>Semiconductor physics/lithography technology</li>
							<li>Computer architecture</li>
							<li>Metrology - I'm a sucker for optical flats</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						This website is still very much WIP, but it will serve quite a few purposes.
						<ul>
							<li>A personal page for my projects/hobbies</li>
							<li>A display of some photos I've taken (mostly the good ones)</li>
							<li>
								Useful references and technical material about my interests (links to come soon), such as
								<ul>
									<li><a href="./resources/hspindex.html">High speed photography</a></li>
									<li>Holography</li>
									<li>Normal Photography</li>
									<li>Optics</li>
									<!--more to be added later-->
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Random stuff</li>
						</ul>
						Please use the index to the right to browse around.<br><br>
						I hope your visit will be informative, entertaining, or both.<br>
						Additionally, if you have any comments, questions, suggestions, or just want to talk, please email me with the link below.
