<h1>Young's website :)</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi, I'm Young He, a first-year undergraduate at the
University of Texas at Austin.<br>I'm pursuing a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>

<p>This website is still in progress, but it will be serve quite a few purposes. </p>
<ul>
<li> A display of some photos I've taken (or at least the good ones :))
<li> Useful references and technical material about some of my interests, such as
	<ul><li><a href="./resources/hspindex.html">High speed photography</a><li>Holography<li>Normal photography<li>Optics<li>more to be added later!</ul>
<li> Showcasing some of my hobbies/projects
<li> random junk
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Anyways, here's some stuff about me if you're interested!</p>
<ul><li>I like photography and anything to do with lenses/optics/imaging, as is perhaps
obvious from the former links
<li> I'm also very into analog circuit design (including RF 
engineering; I'm currently studying for the Technician class
<br>amateur radio license) as well as semiconductor physics and 
applications, especially with regard to optics such as
semiconductor lasers and image sensors. 
<li>My future degree technical track will be in nanotechnology. 
<li> I also dabble in computer architecture - I'm especially interested in 
<a href="./projects/subleq.html">one instruction set processors</a> and transport-triggered architectures.
</ul>

<p>Please browse around and please email me for any comments/suggestions/discussion!</p>
<p>I hope you will find your visit informative, entertaining, or both.</p>
