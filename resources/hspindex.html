<h1>High Speed Photography References</h1>
<hr>
<p>If you would like to learn more about the technology behind high speed photography, please check out
<a href="./HSPguide.html">this page</a> I have put together. As with the rest of this website, it's still very WIP, but I hope that
it will be a comprehensive resource that gives a thorough understanding of the various types of 
high speed camears while still being light on math. There is a (perhaps surprising) lack of easy to follow
information about high speed cameras so I hope that this resource will be informative and interesting.</p>
<hr>
<p>Here's a load of papers and resources that I've gathered related to the fascinating field of high speed photography.<br>
Most of it pertains to <i>multiple frame</i> imaging of an event, <b>not</b> the single flash
single frame photography some (rather erroneously) call "high speed photography".</p>
<p>Since there are many different types of high speed cameras, I've categorized them as follows: 
<br>
<ol>
<li>Rotating mirror optical compensation cameras
<li>Image dissection cameras (all types)
<li>Rotating prism/rotating drum framing cameras
<li>Rotating mirror streak cameras
<li>Image tube based systems (streak and framing)
<li>Digital high speed photography
<li>Other
</ol>
<br>Some papers fall under numerous categories so please bear with my rather arbitrary categorizing.<br>The perceptive viewer may notice that these are very similar to the chapter divisions Dubovik uses in <i>The Photographic Recording of High-Speed Processes</i>. I would personally consider his work to be the most comprehensive guide to high-speed photography ever published.</p>
<p>I've included (when applicable) the name of the paper, authors, date, category, and a Sci-Hub link if available.<br>
Please email me if links stop working.</p>
