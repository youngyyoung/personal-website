            <p>I'm very passionate about photography and imaging of all kinds, but most of my casual photography is focused on "aesthetic" pictures. </p>

            <div>The F5 is a battery burner and very heavy, but it's definitely a workhorse.</div>

            <p>My most productive camera by far is my Nikon F5 - I bought it for $50 a couple years ago on Craigslist and it's a joy to use. I'm currently looking to upgrade to a digital camera but that'll have to wait a while.</p>
            <p>I have a darkroom and used to process (C-41) and print (RA-4) my film myself, but unfortunately I don't have the time for it nowadays so I have to pay outrageous prices for processing at a lab.</p>
            <p>At any rate, 35mm is a bit of a resolution dead-end, especially with color. People <i>love</i> to claim that normal 35mm film can get 24 megapixels or higher, but that's simply not true in most cases. A lot of lenses can barely resolve 24 MP, let alone the film. </p>
