            <p>I'm very interested in all kinds of imaging - normal photography, high speed photography, holography, astrophotography, etc. I love the application of imaging to technical subjects but most of my casual photography is just focused on nice-looking photos.</p>

            <div>The F5 is a battery burner and very heavy, but it's definitely a workhorse.<br><br>

            <p>My most productive camera by far is my Nikon F5 - I bought it for $50 a couple years ago on Craigslist and it's a joy to use. I'm currently looking to upgrade to a digital camera for action and birding; while the F5 can <i>technically</i> burn through film at 8 fps, I don't have a money tree.</p>
            <p>I have a darkroom and used to process (C-41) and print (RA-4) my film myself, but unfortunately I don't have the time for it nowadays so I have to pay outrageous prices for processing at a lab.</p>
            <p>My Nikon gear includes the 105mm f/2.8 Micro-Nikkor, a 50mm 1.8D, and the 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5 G. I've ammased a small assortment of cameras but I almost exclusively use the F5. Among other advantages, the matrix metering is truly magical.</p>
