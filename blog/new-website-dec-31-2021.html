            <h2>New website!</h2>
            <p><i>December 31, 2021</i></p>
            <hr>
            <p>I've always wanted a website to share some of my interests and provide some resources for other people with similar interests, and I've finally sat down and done it! I still have a large quantity of work to do, but it's definitely a start.</p>
            <p>I was originally going to stick with the early 2000's website vibes but I've come to realize having CSS styling makes everything much easier and nicer. However, I can still KISS - I've written <i>everything</i> myself and I'm trying to keep it minimalist.</p>
            <p>I hope this website (especially the high-speed photography guide) will be helpful. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
