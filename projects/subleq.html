<h1>Subleq Processor</h1>
<p>In November 2021 I designed a simple OISC - A <b>O</b>ne <b>I</b>nstruction <b>S</b>et <b>C</b>omputer.
<h3>What is an OISC?</h3>
<p>As the name implies, an OISC has only one instruction. <br>
Processor architectures used in modern hardware such as x86 or ARM are quite complicated
and often have hundreds of instructions ranging from add and subtract to even AES encryption. </p>
<p>An OISC simplifies the architecture greatly as the instruction is <i>implied</i>.<br>
Why is an implied instruction useful? For starters, it greatly simplifies instruction formatting; 
since there is only one instruction there is no need for an opcode - every instruction merely 
contains the operands necessary for the one instruction.
<br><br>Additionally, there is no need for complex decoding circuitry to determine the instruction the
 processor is to perform - there is only one instruction it can execute. Thus, instead of the
 traditional processor cycle of Fetch, Decode, and Execute, the OISC merely needs to fetch and execute.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a reason why OISCs are not used outside of novelty processors. This realization
 is immediately apparent to anyone who has tried to program with a single instruction. It simply takes
 too much work to <i>anything</i>. Of course, transcompilers between, say, C and an OISC can be made with
 not unreasonable difficulty, but the resulting code is very memory inefficient. Thus, OISCs are (perhaps
 unfortunately) relegated to curiosities amongst the esoteric computer architecture community.</p>
<p>Anyways, onto my implementation! I used Logisim to design and implement the processor.</p>
The one instruction that it uses is subleq - subtract and branch if less than or equal to zero. </p>

<p>more to be added later...</p>
